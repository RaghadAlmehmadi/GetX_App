# Favorite Toggle App

A simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to toggle a favorite (heart) icon using GetX for state management. When the icon is pressed, it switches between an empty heart (`Icons.favorite_border`) and a filled heart (`Icons.favorite`) with a red background.

## Features

- Toggle between favorite and non-favorite states
- Uses Getx for reactive state management
- Responsive UI with `Obx`
- Red background behind the favorite icon when selected
